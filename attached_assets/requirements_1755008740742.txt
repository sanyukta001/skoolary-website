# skoolary Website Documentation

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a static, multi-page marketing website for "skoolary," a school bus tracking solution. The website provides information about the service, its features, and benefits for parents and schools. It includes sections for "About," "How it Works," "msb Apps," "Benefits," "Testimonials," and a contact form(this will be attached to google sheets no backend or database to be maintained).

## 2. File Structure

The project follows a simple file structure:

React website with three js for more interactive which exites the kids and its playful website with interactive ui

it should have simple file structure which includes src/pages/, src/assests, src/components

## 3. Design and UI

The website uses a modern, clean, and professional design.

-   **Color Palette**: The primary color scheme consists of:
    -   **Yellow**: Used as an accent color, especially for buttons and highlights.
    -   **Black/Dark Gray**: Used for text and background sections.
    -   **White**: Used for text and backgrounds.
    -   **Default Blue**: Used for links and some icons.
-   **Typography**: The website uses a sans-serif font (likely from the "bundle.min.css" or a web font service) for readability. It uses a combination of font weights (light, normal, bold) to create a clear visual hierarchy.
-   **Layout**: The layout is responsive and adapts to different screen sizes. It uses a combination of full-width sections and a container-based layout to structure the content. The navigation is a sticky header that becomes opaque on scroll.

## 4. Frontend Workflow

The website is a single-page application, where navigation links scroll the user to different sections of the page.

### HTML Structure

The `index.html` file is divided into the following main sections:

-   **Header (`<header>`):** Contains the navigation bar and the side menu for mobile devices. The navigation bar includes the logo and links to different sections of the page.
-   **Main Slider (`<section id="main-banner-area">`):** A full-width banner with a slider (Revolution Slider) that showcases the main marketing messages.
-   **Services (`<div id="services-slider">`):** An Owl Carousel slider that displays the key features of the service.

-   **Library CSS**: The `css` directory also contains the stylesheets for the various JavaScript libraries used in the project, such as Owl Carousel and Revolution Slider.

    -   Initializing the Owl Carousel sliders for services, partners, and testimonials.
    -   Initializing the Revolution Slider for the main banner.
    -   Handling the smooth scrolling for the navigation links.
    -   Managing the side menu for mobile devices.
    -   Animating the counters when they scroll into view.
